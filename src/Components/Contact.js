              What is Diwine Dinings customer care?
              <p>
                We value our customerâ€™s time and hence moved away from a single
                customer care number to a comprehensive chat-based support
                system for quick and easy resolution.
                <br /> You no longer have to go through the maze of an IVRS call
                support. Just search for your issue in the help section on this
                page and initiate a chat with us. A customer care executive{" "}
                <br /> will be assigned to you shortly. You can also email us
                your issue on support@swiggy.in Note: We value your privacy and
                your information is safe with us. Please do not reveal any
                personal information, bank account number, OTP etc. to another
                person. A Swiggy representative will never ask you for these
                details. Please do not reveal these details to fraudsters and
                imposters claiming to be calling on our behalf. Be vigilant and
                do not entertain phishing calls or emails
